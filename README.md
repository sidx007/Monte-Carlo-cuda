# American Option Pricing Engine

**GPU-accelerated Bermudan option pricing by Longstaff-Schwartz least-squares Monte Carlo, in CUDA and OpenMP.**

Started as a reimplementation of *Cvetanoska & Stojanovski, "Using High Performance
Computing and Monte Carlo Simulation for Pricing American Options"*. The paper's
valuation method turned out to be **systematically wrong** — biased 56% high at 21
exercise dates, and the bias grows without bound. This engine replaces it with
Longstaff-Schwartz, validates the result against two independent references, and
runs it 53× faster than a serial CPU baseline.

| --- | --- |
| **Exact price** (Black-Scholes, non-dividend call) | `10.450584` |
| **This engine** (QMC, 4M paths) | `10.450566` — error `−1.7e-5` |
| **The paper's method** | `16.34` — error `+5.89` |
| **Speedup** | 53.4× serial · 10.0× 28-thread OpenMP |
| **Tests** | 17 checks, 2 suites, all passing |

## The headline result

An American **call on a non-dividend-paying stock is worth exactly its European
counterpart** — early exercise is never optimal. That makes Black-Scholes an exact
yardstick, and any gap is bias, not noise.

The paper values each path with `max(intrinsic, discounted continuation)` using
**that path's own realised future**. Every path exercises with hindsight, so the
estimator is biased high and gets worse the more exercise dates you give it.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Simulate N paths<br/>GBM, m+1 timesteps"] --> B["Node m<br/>European value of<br/>remaining dt"]
    B --> C{"For i = m-1 … 1"}
    C --> D["Discount every<br/>cashflow one step"]
    D --> E["Regress cashflow on<br/>1, x, x² over<br/>in-the-money paths"]
    E --> F["Exercise where<br/>intrinsic > fitted<br/>continuation"]
    F --> C
    C -->|done| G["Mean × discount<br/>= price ± stderr"]
```

Two details make it correct rather than merely plausible:

- **The regression supplies the exercise *decision* only.** Valuation always uses the
  realised cashflow, never the fitted value. Substituting the fit back in
  reintroduces bias.
- **Only in-the-money paths enter the regression.** Out-of-the-money paths carry no
  decision, and including them degrades the fit exactly where the exercise boundary
  lives.

The estimator is *low-biased*: a fitted policy is suboptimal, and a suboptimal
exercise policy under-values. That is the safe direction.

### Time grid

With `dt = T/(m+1)`, path value `S[i]` sits at `i·dt`. The last grid point is at
`T − dt`, not `T`: the `m` exercise opportunities are at `dt, 2dt, …, m·dt`, and the
option still has `dt` of life left after the final one. Node `m` therefore needs no
regression — holding is worth the European value over the remaining step, which is an
exact conditional expectation.

---

## Validation

A call cannot distinguish "LSM works" from "LSM never exercises", because never
exercising *is* the right answer there. So the suite checks both directions:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph exact ["Exact references"]
        BS["Black-Scholes<br/>closed form"]
        TREE["CRR binomial tree<br/>same m exercise dates"]
    end
    subgraph mc ["Monte Carlo backends"]
        CALL["Call<br/>never exercises early"]
        PUT["Put<br/>exercise boundary binds"]
    end
    BS -->|"must match exactly"| CALL
    TREE -->|"must match within 0.14%"| PUT
    CALL --> V["17 checks<br/>all passing"]
    PUT --> V
    XB["Cross-backend checks<br/>GPU vs CPU · 1 vs 28 threads"] --> V
```

The tree is restricted to the **same `m` exercise dates** the Monte Carlo grid uses,
so both price the identical Bermudan. Comparing against a fully American tree would
be apples to oranges — continuous exercise is worth strictly more than `m` discrete
dates.

| Check | What it catches | Result |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| American call == European | Any bias; does not shrink with N | err < 0.017 |
| American put vs CRR tree | A wrong exercise boundary | within 0.14% |
| Early-exercise premium > 0 | An exercise rule that never fires | +1.2192 |
| Sobol vs van der Corput | Bit-reversed direction numbers | exact |
| OpenMP 1 thread vs 28 | A wrong reduction in the regression | 2.8e-13 |
| GPU QMC vs host QMC | Device Sobol/bridge/LSM drift | < 1e-6 |
| fp32 vs fp64 paths | Precision loss that actually matters | 8e-6 |

### Convergence

  <img alt="Log-log absolute error against path count; the Sobol QMC curve sits about an order of magnitude below the pseudo-random one" src="docs/img/convergence-light.png">
</picture>

QMC reaches three-decimal accuracy at 100,000 paths where the pseudo-random backends
need 1,000,000. The LCG curve ticking *up* between 10⁶ and 4×10⁶ is not a bug —
Monte Carlo error is a random walk around zero, not a monotone decline.

## Profiling: two wrong guesses, then the real bottleneck

The first correct version ran only 19× serial, which is poor for an embarrassingly
parallel problem. Rather than guess, `./build/profile_gpu` splits device time into
path generation and the LSM backward pass. It killed both obvious hypotheses:

| Hypothesis | Measured reality |
| --- | --- |
| The 19 host round trips for the regression solve dominate | Under 1 ms of a 56 ms pass |
| Uncoalesced reads dominate (paths were point-major, threads 168 B apart) | Time-major layout changed runtime **< 2%** |
| — | **FP64 arithmetic in path generation: 63%** |

Path generation is transcendental-heavy — one `exp` per step plus two `log`s in
Moro's tail branch — on a card that runs doubles at 1/64 the FP32 rate. Moving path
storage and generation to fp32, **while keeping the regression accumulation in
double**, gives 2.7× for a price change of `8e-6` against a Monte Carlo standard
error of `7.1e-3` — a thousandth of the noise it sits inside.

> The time-major layout was kept regardless. It is the correct layout and costs
> nothing; it simply was not the bottleneck.

### A bug the fp32 experiment surfaced

At four million paths the single-precision run returned `inf`.
`__uint2float_rn(0xFFFFFFFF)` rounds up to exactly 2³², so the float LCG can emit
exactly `1.0`, and Moro then evaluates `log(−log(0))`. **The same hole existed in the
double path all along** — LCG state `0` gives `u = 0` — merely rare enough never to
have fired. Both are now clamped inside Φ⁻¹ itself, where the function is genuinely
undefined, rather than at the four call sites. Two regression tests cover it.

## Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

CUDA targets are skipped automatically if no toolkit is present; `-DUSE_CUDA=OFF`
skips them deliberately.

> **Host compiler:** nvcc pins its own supported GCC (CUDA 12.4 tops out at GCC 13).
> If your default `g++` is newer, configure with `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-13`, or
> linking `run_cuda_tests` fails on an undefined `__cxa_call_terminate`. CMake warns
> when it detects the mismatch.

> **CUDA arch:** defaults to `sm_80` with PTX emitted alongside, so newer GPUs JIT.
> Override with `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=89` (Ada), `90` (Hopper), etc.

## Known limitations

These are open, not hidden:

- **Pseudo-random streams are not independent.** Path seeds are
  `(path_id + 1) × 1234567` on a 2³² LCG, so neighbouring paths walk correlated
  positions on the same lattice. A counter-based generator (cuRAND Philox) is the fix.
- **No error bar on the QMC result.** `sd/√N` assumes independent draws and Sobol is
  deterministic; at 4×10⁶ the QMC backends *report* a standard error of `0.0071` while
  the actual error is `0.000017`. A real bound needs randomised QMC — average over
  several independent digital shifts and take the sd of the means.
- **LSM is low-biased**, so a true confidence interval needs a paired upper bound
  (the Andersen-Broadie dual).
- **Memory bounds the problem.** The regression is cross-sectional, so the whole path
  set must be resident: `N × (m+1)` values, 336 MB at N=4×10⁶ in fp64.
- **The GPU is handicapped here.** CUDA 12.4 has no native sm_120 target, so kernels
  arrive by PTX JIT from sm_80.
